# Data Analytics Consulting Forage Virtual Internship

This repository contains my solution to the [Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship?ref=SALn4i2GnpTPwHSn8) on Forage.

## Introduction
KPMG firms operate in 146 countries and territories across the globe, offering audit, tax and advisory services.

## Task 1
Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

## Task 2
Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. 

In building this recommendation, we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take. 

Please ensure your PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.
